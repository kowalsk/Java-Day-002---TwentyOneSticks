# Java-Day-002---TwentyOneSticks
Modified version of http://www.java-made-easy.com/fun-java-game.html

The rules of the game are simple. You start with 21 sticks, and two players take turns either taking one or two sticks. The player who takes the last stick loses. Simple.

I have modified code so it is less repetitive and extracted the same code to separate methods.
